# 👋 Welcome to Cirrondly

Cirrondly is an AI-powered cloud cost & usage intelligence platform.
We help teams understand *what is happening* in their cloud, in real time, and *why it matters*.

## 🚀 What is Cirrondly?

Modern cloud systems generate massive amounts of usage, cost, and activity signals.
Cirrondly turns those raw signals into **clear insights**, **anomaly detection**, and **business impact visibility**.

Instead of dashboards full of metrics,
Cirrondly answers questions like:

- Why did my cloud costs spike *right now*?
- Which feature, user action, or deployment caused it?
- What is the real usage behind my infrastructure?
- What will this cost if traffic doubles?

---

## 🧠 Core Focus

- 🔍 **Real-time cost & usage signals**
- ⚠️ **AI-driven anomaly detection**
- 🔗 **Usage → infrastructure → cost correlation**
- 📈 **Cloud cost forecasting & growth simulation**
- ☁️ **Designed for modern cloud & AI workloads**

Cirrondly is built for **startups, scaleups, and product teams** who want clarity, not spreadsheets.

---

## 🏗️ Project Status

Cirrondly is currently **under active development**.
We are building the foundations of a next-generation FinOps & observability platform.

This GitHub organization hosts:
- core services
- SDKs
- experiments
- infrastructure tooling

Some repositories may be **private or in early stages**.
